Other crosshair programs offer a single style or color option, and often don't allow you to reposition them. CrossOver is a small, unintrusive crosshair overlay which has plenty of configuration options to assist with aiming and vision of your crosshair. CrossOver offers a huge improvement to many games' default crosshairs for those with colorblindness or contrast issues.

###### _Thanks to Reddit user /u/IrisFlame for the premade library of crosshairs!_

---

## Settings

##### Crosshair

Choose from over 100 real and fictional crosshairs, or use your own by dragging an image to the window. You can change the size and opacity.

##### Reticle

The reticle is the small dot or cross at the center of the sight. You can select the shape and the color, or this can be turned off.

##### Hide on ADS

Choose a mouse button to use as your ADS button. The crosshair will be hidden while this button is held down.

##### Harware acceleration

A handful of users have reported FPS issues with certain games ([#70](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/70)), CrossOver should not add any FPS or latency so if you experience it, toggle this setting on or off and disable [`Hide on ADS`](#hide-on-ads)

##### Start on boot

You can automatically set CrossOver to start when your system starts on your gaming PC, so you're always ready to pop heads.

##### Automatic Updates

By default CrossOver will automatically keep itself updated with bug fixes and improvements. You can disable this in the settings to prevent all network requests.
CrossOver will _only_ connect to GitHub to download published releases and does not send or store _any_ personal data. I'm a solo developer and you aren't important to me üôÇ I just want to game.

#### Keybinds

> See [default keyboard shortcuts](#default-keyboard-shortcuts).
> All of the keybinds can be changed or disabled except for the bind to reset all settings. Click into the input and press your bind, or press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> to disable a bind.

Keep in mind that keybinds may conflict with other programs so be careful about what you choose. There's no real mechanism for preventing you from setting two conflicting keyinds within the app, so don't do that.

##### Duplicate crosshairs

Duplicate crosshair windows use the same settings as the main window and do not support all of the features of the main window. Settings for duplicate crosshairs will not be saved and all duplicate windows will be closed if the main window is closed. Duplicate crosshairs cannot follow the mouse.

##### Reset

To reset all settings and binds to default, press <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>R</kbd>

## Development

Built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org). Simple HTML and Javascript, no framework.

Start developing in `src/main.js` and `src/renderer.js`. `index.html` contains the layout and `index.scss` contains the styles for the main app [`BrowserWindow`]()

### Run

_You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.4.X installed. If you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm use` to switch to the correct node version._

```
$ yarn && yarn start
```

### Build

> Build steps optimized for Mac, see [electron.builder](http://electron.builder) for help customizing builds.

_wine_ and _mono_ must be installed for Windows builds _(macOS)_
[_multipass_](https://multipass.run/) must be installed for Snap builds _(macOS)_

```
$ yarn build
```

> Or `yarn build:all`

### Publish

```
$ yarn release
```

Then edit the automatically created GitHub Releases draft and publish.

## Bugs

### [Hidden by fullscreen apps](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/1)

Currently CrossOver only works with windowed applications, use `Windowed Fullscreen` mode if your game or application supports it. _Windows_ -

Fullscreen for MacOS may have better results.

#### Workaround

If you absolutely need to use `Fullscreen` mode, or your game is not supported by crossover, there is a workaround using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

_Doesn't work with some games [#47](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/47#issuecomment-895995990), and causes FPS issues in other cases_

Install AutoHotKey and run this script with it (save it as `script.ahk` and double-click it):

```autohotkey
Home::Winset, Alwaysontop, , CrossOver
```

Once in-game, pressing space should put the crosshair over the screen, even in fullscreen mode.

> via [@girkovarpa](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/47#issuecomment-805017469)

### Graphical issues on Linux

Check your desktop environment. CrossOver may not work on KDE, try GNOME if you experience issues.

## Credits

An extra big thanks to the crosshair providers, as this wouldn't be possible without them:
