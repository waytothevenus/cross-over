Other crosshair programs offer a single style or color option, and often don't allow you to reposition them. CrossOver is a small, unintrusive crosshair overlay which has plenty of configuration options to assist with aiming and vision of your crosshair. CrossOver offers a huge improvement to many games' default crosshairs for those with colorblindness or contrast issues.

# Usage

> ‚ùå marks the spot...

Click and drag the crosshair to anywhere on any screen.

Double-click the drag icon to center the crosshair on the current display.

<kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> to save your settings lock CrossOver in place.

<kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> to quickly hide or show CrossOver.

<kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to reset CrossOver configuration and move the window back to it's original position.

While CrossOver is focused you can use <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Arrows</kbd> while unlocked to move single pixels.

To quit in Windows, toggle the app unlocked and right-click > `Close`.

# Bugs

#### Hidden by fullscreen apps

Currently CrossOver only works with windowed applications, use `Windowed Fullscreen` mode if your game or application supports it. _Windows_ - https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/1

#### Transparency not working

CrossOver will not hide settings when locked. Crosshair loses opacity (becomes opaque). _Linux (debian)_ - https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/5
