Other crosshair programs offer a single style or color option, and often don't allow you to reposition them. CrossOver is a small, unintrusive crosshair overlay which has plenty of configuration options to assist with aiming and vision of your crosshair. CrossOver offers a huge improvement to many games' default crosshairs for those with colorblindness or contrast issues.

###### _Thanks to Reddit user /u/IrisFlame for the premade library of crosshairs!_

## Development

Built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org). Simple HTML and Javascript, no framework.

Start developing in `src/main.js` and `src/renderer.js`. `index.html` contains the layout and `index.scss` contains the styles for the main app [`BrowserWindow`]()

### Run

```
$ npm install && npm start
```

### Build

_wine_ and _mono_ must be installed for Windows builds _(macOS)_
[_multipass_](https://multipass.run/) must be installed for Snap builds _(macOS)_

```
$ npm run build
```


### Publish

```
$ npm run release
```

Then edit the automatically created GitHub Releases draft and publish.


## Bugs

#### [Hidden by fullscreen apps](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/1)

Currently CrossOver only works with windowed applications, use `Windowed Fullscreen` mode if your game or application supports it. _Windows_ -


#### Sight is deformed or off by 1 pixel; App center is not "center"

Monitors use an even number of pixels, so finding a center point can be hard sometimes. Still, report any issues.


#### [Unable to drag or move app window](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/46)

Some Linux distros have experienced this issue, [report your version](https://github.com/lacymorrow/crossover/issues/46)
