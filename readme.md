# CrossOver

> A CrossHair Overlay for any platform.

CrossOver allows you to place a customizable crosshair overlay above any application window.
Improve your aim and gain a competitive advantage with a permanant colored crosshair to mark center screen.

Other crosshair programs offer a single style or color option, and often don't allow you to reposition them. CrossOver is a small, unintrusive crosshair overlay which has plenty of configuration options to assist with aiming and vision of your crosshair. CrossOver offers a huge improvement to many games' default crosshairs for those with colorblindness or contrast issues.

### Features

- Choose from tons of true-to-life sights
- Cross-platform: Windows, MacOS, and Linux support
- Support for multiple monitors
- Choose between center **Dot** or **Crosshair**
- Customize crosshair size, color, and opacity
- Persistant settings remembers your choices automatically


### Usage

> ❌ marks the spot...

Click and drag the crosshair to anywhere on any screen.

Double-click the drag icon to center the crosshair on the current display.

`Control` + `Shift` + `X` to save your settings lock CrossOver in place.

`Control` + `Shift` + `E` to quickly hide or show CrossOver.

`Control` + `Shift` + `R` to reset CrossOver configuration and move the window back to it's original position.

Currently CrossOver only works with windowed applications, use `Windowed Fullscreen` mode if your game or application supports it.
